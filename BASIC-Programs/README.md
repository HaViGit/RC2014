# C and Assembly file upload for new users (No EEPROM programmer required)

Just built a Classic or Mini RC2014, and don't have an EEPROM burner?

Do you still want to do Assembly or C language programming and run these programs on your RC2014?

[`hexload`](https://github.com/RC2014Z80/RC2014/tree/master/BASIC-Programs/hexload) is the way you can upload and run either assembly or C compiled code on your RC2014.
