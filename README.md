## New to the RC2014

Want to get started with Assembly and C programming, but don't have a EEPROM burner?
Then use the [`hexload`](https://github.com/RC2014Z80/RC2014/tree/master/BASIC-Programs/hexload) Basic program to upload your work.

## Contributing and installation notes

This repository links to third party projects and code written for RC2014 (for instance pigfx, some emulators, etc) as git submodules.
To initialize them properly, run the following command (from the repository root) after cloning:

```
$ git submodule update --init
```

Feel free to contribute by forking this repository and issuing a pull request. If you already have a consolidated project already versioned in a git repo you can request to be included as a git submodule.

Have fun and happy hacking :)
